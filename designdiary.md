*  Starting this assignment was really challenging because my work from the other project (that was a complete a total flop), it was really hard
to start with a new project, even though it was clean, I'm having trouble still orienting through the framework and troubleshooting my issues. I feel 
really dependent still on help, and it is frustrating because I want to be more self-sufficient as I love programming, but it is extremely difficult
when I can't get very far by myself or working on a error code, and googling it for hours.

* after meeting up with a classmate who was willing to spend the time with me with an actual deck of cards, and completely ignore the coding part 
of the exercise and focus on conceptualizing what it is that we are actually trying to achieve, I feel less intimidated by the process. We started
with the deck class and worked on how to add to the top and to the bottom. I used shuffle code from my previous assignment, but I needed to do a 
bit of refactoring to make sure I was using the correct variables.

I wanted to make the debug.log displace the value and suit of the card, and not just that it was a poker card when I was adding a deck of cards. 
I added debug log to show the card count. I really over complicated this assignment in my head initally, but after taking the time to work it out
on paper, I feel that it was way more helpful. I did not do as many check ins on this assigment because there was no way to show the hand written
functions on paper and the sevearl hours it took to do that before I was ready to get on the computer and actually start programming. I'm so
glad we had to watch the You Tube tutorials about how to make the UI buttons, and how to associate actions because it was not as hard to navigate 
unity.
